## Description

Briefly tell users why they might want to use your module. Explain what your module does and what kind of problems users can solve with it.

This should be a fairly short description helps the user decide if your module is what they want.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

This module connects to the WSUS SQL server. To do this we make use of the
[sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) Ruby lubrary and the underlying
[tiny_tds](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds) adapter, which relies on the
[FreeTDS](https://www.freetds.org/) C library. Below are basic instructions for setting up
FreeTDS on the node you're running bolt from so that this module can communicate
with the WSUS SQL Server and generate inventory. For more instructions on your platform
of choice, checkout the `tiny_tds` and `freetds` instructions for your platform on Google.

#### Setup Requirements: RHEL/CentOS

``` shell
# install freetds
sudo yum -y install freetds freetds-devel
/opt/puppetlabs/bolt/bin/gem install sequel tiny_tds
```

#### Setup Requirements: Debian

``` shell
# install freetds
sudo apt-get -y install freetds-bin freetds-dev
/opt/puppetlabs/bolt/bin/gem install sequel tiny_tds
```

#### Setup Requirements: Windows

``` shell
# freetds is compiled staticly and installed alongside the tiny_tds library on Windows
/opt/puppetlabs/bolt/bin/gem install sequel tiny_tds
```

### Example usage in inventory

Dynamically grab computers from WSUS

``` yaml
---
version: 2.0

groups:
  - name: windows_wsus
    config:
      transport: winrm
      winrm:
        user: xxx
        password:
          _plugin: pkcs7
          encrypted_value: ENC[PKCS7,xxx]
        ssl: true
        ssl-verify: false
    vars:
      patching_order: 1
    groups:
      # grabs a list of groups from WSUS
      - _plugin: wsus_inventory
        # creds to login to the WSUS MSSQL database
        host: wsus.domain.tld
        database: 'SUSDB'
        username: DOMAIN\svc_wsus_bolt
        password:
          _plugin: pkcs7
          encrypted_value: ENC[PKCS7,xxx]
        # return a list of 'groups', this could also be 'targets'
        format: 'groups'
        # names of groups to extract from WSUS, these need to match exactly what is in WSUS
        # note: this will be downcased when returned because Bolt only allows lowercase names
        groups:
          - Servers_A
          - Servers_B
          - Servers_A_EDR
          - Servers_B_EDR
          - Servers_HV
        # remove hosts that haven't checked into WSUS in the last N days
        filter_older_than_days: 1
        # insert windows_wsus_ before the group names we get from WSUS
        # so we will get groups like: windows_wsus_servers_a
        group_name_prefix: 'windows_wsus_'

```
